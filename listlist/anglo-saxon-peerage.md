# Anglo-Saxon Peerage

</br>

The concept of a peerage originates long before Anglo-Saxon England, taking varying forms but always serving to elevate certain peoples within a feudal system comprising 'classes' based on wealth, land ownership, social status, etc. 

Anglo-Saxon England comprised a number of kingdoms that rose and fell during the mediæval period, each having a local system of peerage depending on the kingdom's size, fealty to other kingdoms, etc. Generally, four groups of classes can be distinguished:

- The **Monarchy** — *the ultimate ruling power, i.e., the king.*
- The **Nobility** — *the administrative power over a region.*
- The **Free Labourers** — *the emancipated or those born free.*
- The **Slaves** — *the indentured workers (by debt, war, or birth).*

The mediæval period evidenced the Germanic concept of a **weregild** – in simple terms, the monetary value attached to a person's life should they die. The implementation of weregild was complicated and varied between kings – but abstraction demonstrates a clear hierarchy. Values given here are from the Kingdom of Northumbria's *Norðleoda Laga*,<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> and are in *'thrymsas'* – a gold coin common before widespread use of silver sceats and pennies.

## Monarchy

### King (*cyning*) – **30 000 thrymsas**

- At the top was the *king*, a role constitutionally inherited through a 'god-given' right to rule over the kingdom.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> Several times during the Mediæval period, particularly bold monarchs such as *Offa* **of Mercia** and *Alfred the Great* **of Wessex** saw to expand their empires by subduing other kingly rulers through conquering or demanding fealty.

## Nobility

### Aetheling (*æþeling) – **15 000 thrymsas**

- The aethelings were princes of the royal dynasty who were thus eligible for the kingship via primogeniture.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> They also generally maintained a royal retinue of advisors and guards.

### Gesith (*ġesīþ*)

- The gesith were companions to an aethel or a king, who would later travel with, advise, and defend their lords. They came to be replaced by 'thanes'.<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>

### Ealdorman (*ealdorman*) – **8 000 thrymsas**

- The ealdormen were the chief magistrates of a shire (county) in charge of leading battles and organising taxes levied by the monarch.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>

### Reeve (*ġerēfa*) – **4 000 thrymsas**

- The reeves were officials with local jurisdiction under the king, who acted as the chief magistrates of a district.<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> The later office of 'shire-reeve' (*sċirġerēfa*) originates the modern term of *'sheriff'*.

### Thane (*þæġn / þeġen / þeġn*) – **2 000 thrymsas**

- The thanes were aristocratic retainers of a king, to wit, a senior nobleman.<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> They were also known by the term *twelfynde man* (twelve-hundred man) in reference to the later weregild of 1 200 shillings. Their standard land ownership was ~ 5 *hides* (600 ac.).
