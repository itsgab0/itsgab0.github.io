# Anglo-Saxon Peerage

</br>

The concept of a peerage originates long before Anglo-Saxon England, taking varying forms but always serving to elevate certain peoples within a feudal system comprising 'classes' based on wealth, land ownership, social status, etc. 

Anglo-Saxon England comprised a number of kingdoms that rose and fell during the mediæval period, each having a local system of peerage depending on the kingdom's size, fealty to other kingdoms, etc. Generally, four groups of classes can be distinguished:

- The **Monarchy** — *the ultimate ruling power, i.e., the king.*
- The **Nobility** — *the administrative power over a region.*
- The **Free Labourers** — *the emancipated or those born free.*
- The **Slaves** — *the indentured workers (by debt, war, or birth).*

The mediæval period evidenced the Germanic concept of a **weregild** – in simple terms, the monetary value attached to a person's life should they die. The implementation of weregild was complicated and varied between kings – but abstraction demonstrates a clear hierarchy. Values given here are from the Kingdom of Northumbria's *Norðleoda Laga*,<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> and are in *'thrymsas'* – a gold coin common before widespread use of silver sceats and pennies.
