# British Pre-Decimal Coinage

<br>

## Introduction

Since the *15th of February 1971*, the United Kingdom has used a *decimal* currency – the main unit being the **pound** (£) worth 100 **pence** (sg. *penny*). Prior to *Decimalisation Day*, the United Kingdom maintained a complicated system called *£sd* – **pounds, shillings and pence** – with origins in Ancient Roman currency:

- £ — **pound** — (<span class="latin">*lībra*</span><sup>LAT</sup> – 'pound')
- s — **shilling** — (<span class="latin">*solidus*</span><sup>LAT</sup> – 'solid')
- d — **penny** — (<span class="latin">*denarius*</span><sup>LAT</sup> – 'ten of')

In the lead up to *Decimalisation Day*, the three subdivisions above were the primary 'units' of British coinage, with coins officially representing multiples of one or more units, but often had individual names with historical significance. Specific coins weren't necessarily always minted for the same period of time, though the individually-named coins were consistently present.

The **pound** comprised 20 **shillings**, each worth 12 **pence**. Values were written to personal preference, but general conventions include:
- Values containing all three units were written like *£3/9/1*
- Values in **pounds** and **shillings** were written like *£5/11* or *£3/–*
- Values in **shillings** and **pence** were written like *2/6* or *4/–*
- Values in just one unit were also written like *£5* or *16 s.* or *9 d.*
- Additionally, when spoken the words 'shillings' and 'pence' were generally omitted, such that *4/6* would be pronounced "four and six"

Furthermore, a number of coins were produced in specific colonies during Britain's colonial period, mandated either by the local government or the British overlordship. For example, the **Holey Dollar** of *PEI* and *NSW* was produced by punching out the centre of a Spanish 'piece of eight'. The value of individual coins ranged from *<sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> d.* (mod. eq. £0.004) up to *£5/5/–* (mod. eq. £73.94).<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>
