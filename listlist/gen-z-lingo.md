# Gen Z Lingo

<br>

## Introduction

Despite the title, the terms documented here have been invented or popularised by people belonging to three of the popularly-defined generations:

- **Millenials** (Generation Y): early 1980s – late 1990s

- **Zoomers** (Generation Z): late 1990s – early 2010s

- **Gen Alpha** (Generation Alpha): early 2010s – mid 2020s

People born in the above generations are notable for having grown up in a new age of technology and, as generations before them have done, they have developed a distinct sense of humour and ways of communicating borne out of the social and global context of their time. Prominent features include heavy usage of ironic and postironic humour, and a mixture of absurdism and escapism.

The vocabulary also includes marked influences from a mixture of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, incorporating terms from **AAVE** (African American Vernacular English) and **MLE** (Multicultural London English). Online use has also facilitated increased usage of abbreviations, which don't generally translate well into spoken speech, and are typically replaced by their 'full forms'.

It should come as no surprise to anyone who has ever interacted with a member of this demographic, but no amount of study and practice to emulate their speech will ultimately fail due to a number of unspoken and unwritten rules, along with the medium-dependent context.

## Key Media

Modern social media services allow users to 'follow' or 'subscribe' to other users, which affects a media 'feed' that aggregates all new content from 'followed' or 'subscribed' users. Additionally, many social media services will offer a separate 'feed' with new content chosen based off of user reading/watching data.

- *Facebook* (2004 —): An American social networking service. Users post messages, pictures, and videos to their personal page or to a topical subcommunity, e.g., a page for a town's inhabitants or a page for fans of a celebrity.
- *YouTube* (2005 —): An American video sharing service. Users post videos of any length, e.g., musical performances, sketch comedy, or video essays.
- *Reddit* (2005 —): An American media sharing service. Users post news articles, pictures, and videos to a topical subcommunity (a subreddit), e.g., 'r/news' or 'r/memes'.
- *X* (formerly, *Twitter*) (2006 —): An American social networking service. Users post messages (a tweet), pictures, and videos which are topically identified with hashtags, e.g., '#news' or '#music'.
- *Instagram* (2010 —): An American media sharing service. Users post pictures and videos to friends or publically.
- *Vine* (2013 – 2017): A defunct American short-form video sharing service. Users posted videos up to 6 seconds long, e.g., sketch comedy or clips from longer videos.
- *Musical.ly* (2014 – 2018): A defunct Chinese video sharing service. Users posted videos featuring dancing or lip-syncing with background audio from songs, tv, and movies. Merged into TikTok.
- *TikTok* (2016 —): A Chinese short-form video sharing service, and successor to *Musical.ly*. Users post videos ranging from a few seconds to several minutes, e.g., dance routines or sketch comedy.


## What Does This Guide Offer?

Do not expect perfect spelling nor grammar, as this guide is purely descriptive of actual usage. No emojis are included either, as that's a whole different kettle of fish. Additionally, any terms that are popular amongst the young generations but have seen great use in decades prior have been omitted, to maximise the *'21st century feel'*. Each term is given with an approximation of their pronunciation, for more information, go to the page 'My English Approximation'.

This guide will inevitably contain lots of profanity, so if that is something the reader deems unacceptable, the author offers this advice:

- Grow up.
