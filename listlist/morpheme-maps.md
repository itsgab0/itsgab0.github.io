# Morpheme Maps

<br>

Not all languages make words and sentences in the same way. First, to simplify a rather complicated idea: a morpheme is a single unit of language that conveys some meaning. For example, the verb *eat* conveys the idea of consuming; then consider the verb form *eaten*, which has **two** morphemes:

- *eat-* ⟶ consuming
- *-en* ⟶ (past tense)

English is considered a mostly **analytical language**; meaning it relies **less** on *inflection* — i.e., altering a root form of a word with affixes or other changes — and **more** on particles and helper words.

In Latin, there exists a noun form called the 'genitive case', which conveys attribution. For example, the noun *Rōma* meaning 'Rome'; then consider the phrase 'the road to Rome' where, in Latin, the 'to' part is encoded when the noun is turned into the genitive, such that *via Rōmae* means '(the) road to Rome'.

When comparing words and phrases between two languages, the morphemic structure of both is important; as just one word (e.g., *Rōmae*) can map to many words in another (e.g., 'to Rome'). A few years ago, a little linguistic exercise was suggested to compare many languages, using the following phrase (with minor changes here and there):

- *I would like to try on a suit I saw in a shop across the street from our hotel.*

The author has attempted to collate as many as possible, converting images to text where possible — hence while every effort was made to transcribe and encode texts accurately, any and all errors should be attributed to the author instead of the original creators.

The author has also attempted to add transliterations for non-Latin scripts — some being more familiar than others. In some cases, the morphemic structure has been elucidated further where possible, due to varying degrees of depth by some of the original authors.

Despite all of this, the word-order can be of varying importance, and while there may be multiple ways to render a single sentence conceptually, it has been presumed that the most 'natural-sounding' word-order has been used.
