# Periodic Table Etymology

<br>

## What is the Periodic Table?

The **Periodic Table** is an ongoing project to categorise the chemical elements; currently, they're ordered based on their **atomic number**, in vertical 'groups' of identical **valence electron** numbers, and in horizontal 'periods' of identical **valence shell** inhabitation.

The first version was developed by the Russian scientist *Dmitri Mendeleev* (Дмитрий Менделеев), whose novel arrangement of the known elements even left room for as-then undiscovered elements, such as the element below silicon that they named '*ekasilicon*' – since identified and named 'Germanium'.

Naming rights generally go to the creator/discoverer of the element, though some have opted to name an element after a famous chemist or physicist. Below is a simplfied form of the Periodic Table, featured only the chemical symbols and atomic numbers; most are colour-coded based on language of origin and assigned a type of name.
