      <p>The Periodic Table is an ongoing project to categorise the chemical elements. Currently they're ordered based on their <b>atomic number</b>, in vertical 'groups' of identical <b>valence electron</b> numbers, and in horizontal 'periods' of identical <b>valence shell</b> inhabitation.</p>
      
      <p>The person credited with creating the first Periodic Table was a Russian scientist called <b>Dmitri Mendeleev</b> (Дмитрий Менделеев).</p>
      
      <p>Their novel arrangement of the known elements even left room for as-then undiscovered elements, such as the element below silicon which they named '<b>ekasilicon</b>' - now known as <b>germanium</b>.</p>
      
      <p>Over time, more and more elements have been discovered, codified and brought to public light, and so too has the periodic table expanded. However, the largest naturally-occuring element on planet Earth is uranium, element-92. This has meant that all greater elements have generally been created through one of two means:</p>
      
      <ul class="list">
        <li><b>Nuclear Fusion</b>: Two atomic nuclei are fused at extreme man-made conditions to form one or more other nuclei.</li>
        <li><b>Particle Collison</b>: Two atomic nuclei are accelerated to extremely-high speeds and forced to collide, temporarily fusing into one or more other nuclei.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>With each new discovery comes the question of what to call the new element. Naming rights have almost always gone to the creator/discoverer of the element, however some have opted to name an element after a famous person, usually another scientist and often one keenly involved in particle physics/chemistry.</p>
      
      <p>Below is a simplified form of the Periodic Table (no mass numbers nor group/period labels, etc) and each element has been colour-coded based on the language of origin. Additionally, the type of name has also been noted, i.e. is it named after a person (eponymic) or a place (toponymic) or perhaps due to an interesting property? </p>
