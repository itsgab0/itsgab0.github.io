      <p>Across almost every culture, we seem to be able to find one piece of heritage/myth wherein a large group of people faced some kind of divine intervention in the form of a great flood. As spoken tales go, there is a remarkable amount of consistency amongst all versions of this myth. Of course, to state they all came from the same myth would be a ludicrous leap, however it should be plain to see that <em>one or several major floods influenced a lot people in ancient history</em>, and the go-to explanation would be that it was deic in nature.</p>
      
      <p>As stated prior, there is a reasonable amount of variability amongst the myths, such as the reason for the flood - some myths say it was an angry deity, others posit a great battle. Given the state of science as far back as the 3<sup>rd</sup> millenium BCE, it's not difficult to see why many suggested divine vengeance. If one understood that tides of oceans ebbed and flowed through the day, and during different parts of the year it tended to get higher than ever, and other times it was lower than ever - why then would one day it go so high that it starts taking lives?</p>
      
      <p>However, <em>cum hoc ergo propter hoc</em>. Hand-in-hand with this belief comes the idea of worldbuilding. Stories and old wives tales are handed down via word of mouth, from generation to generation. All it takes is some personification here and euhemerisation there and suddenly it's not just a series of natural events - you have a proper tale with gods and goddeses, heroes and heroines. Take and use what you know, if you don't understand it - put it into terms you do understand.</p>
      
      <p>The author can't and shan't attempt to justify nor explain the origins of any of the following myths. The above was merely a thought experiment to suggest possibilities, but should be regarded as pure fiction. Additionally, the author makes no attempt to approve nor disprove any body of myth. The border between myth and religion in terms of active worship is such that there are some myths in currently-practiced religions.</p>
      
      <p>This is not an exhaustive list, and will be added to as and when the author has time.</p>
