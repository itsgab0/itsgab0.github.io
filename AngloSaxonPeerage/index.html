      <span class="paragraphBlockHeader">What is Anglo-Saxon Peerage?</span>
      
      <p>The concept of a peerage dates back far beyond Anglo-Saxon England, existing in diverse forms but ultimately a way to organise the different classes of peoples within a kingdom. However, one encounters a problem in attempting to locate a concrete hierarchy and that is the problem of changing times.</p>
      
      <p class="indentParagraph">Within the period of history labelled as 'Anglo-Saxon England', one finds several kingdoms that ebb and flow in power and influence, occasionally conquering or being conquered by each other. Each passing year brought many new kings, and often, new forms of governing.</p>
      
      <p>As such, this guide will not attempt to show the several complicated systems with which to organise the Anglo-Saxons. It will only attempt to highlight some key terms that show up in history to refer to specific groups of people. A useful concept for providing a vague ranking is the idea of a <em>'weregild'</em>, which was the monetary value attached to a person's life should they die.</p>
      
      <p class="indentParagraph">Outside of this weregild, one can group the Anglo-Saxons into roughly 4 groups:<br/><br/><b>The Monarchy</b> - the immediate ruler power, i.e. the king<br/><b>The Nobility</b> - those who held some administrative power over a region, district, or large area<br/><b>The Free Labourers</b> - those who owned and worked their own land, however could still be indebted to a member of the nobility<br/><b>The Slaves</b> - those with very few rights and were forced to work (one could become a slave by debt or war, and likewise could be freed from bondage through the goodness of their master's heart or by paying their way out)</p>
