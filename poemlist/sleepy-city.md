## Sleepy City I – Aged 5

<div class="fancy poem">
Sleepy City is a city that sleeps at day and<br>
is awake at night. Sleepy City is in a world<br>
called Sleepy Abacus. Sleepy Abacus is asleep<br>
at day and awake at night. Do you<br>
want to live in Sleepy Abacus? I want to.<br>
because I want to take a night trip,<br>
because I have never seen night drives.<br>
</div>

## Sleepy City II – Aged 22

<div class="fancy poem">
Moonlight erupts from the sky night and day,<br>
As the city of sleeplessness trembles and sways.<br>
High in the clouds sits a grid of shallow lights,<br>
Like an abacus, starlight accords a dull haze.<br>

But all is not lost in this city accursèd,<br>
As a young boy is driven through mist thick and turgid.<br>
He sits in the back seat of his parents’ grey car,<br>
And he dreams of a poem so cleverly worded.<br>
