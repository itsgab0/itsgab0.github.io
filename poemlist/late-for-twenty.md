# Late for Twenty

<div class="cd smcp">Gabe Foad â€” ix.2021</div>

<div class="fancy poem">
My heartbeat swells<br>
The memories draw near<br>
All I've achieved<br>
And all that I've feared<br>

What have I done<br>
Where to go now<br>
But nobody knows<br>
No insight endowed<br>

I scream to the void<br>
As I watch the stars dancing<br>
It seems the silent expanse<br>
Is ever advancing<br>
