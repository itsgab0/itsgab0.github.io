# A Flood of Lies

<div class="cd smcp">Gabe Foad — iii.2023</div>

<div class="fancy poem">
A bed of lies is hailed a throne by those who fail to see,<br>
the fiction in the lines of sand that tell tales of the sea.<br>
Father Time is constant, waiting, never slowing down,<br>
the lies catch up; or so they say, as sinners take their crown.<br>

The seas advance, a war of wits, as creatures come to life,<br>
but who will pay the final price for all the pain and strife?<br>
A liar's throne is lonely while they obfuscate the truth,<br>
when through it all, the watch hand snaps and grants eternal youth.<br>

Great ocean creatures manifest as kingdoms rise and fall;<br>
protection guaranteed behind the liar's slave-built wall.<br>
Indulgent fabrications saved expenses at the cost,<br>
of lower levels—untold lives unfortunately lost.<br>

The rule – liar – sits alone atop the diamond arch,<br>
from smaller lies to lavish lives did nothing for their heart.<br>
The seas retreat, their mission done, although the monarch stands,<br>
on barren shores, the broken watch lay mute with mocking hands.<br>
