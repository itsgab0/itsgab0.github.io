# The Park Bench

“Dedicated herein upon this bench, we lay to rest: the late George Cobbler,” I read. ‘It’s nice,’ I thought to myself. There are definitely worse ways to be remembered – some people are forgotten as soon as they die, as if they had never existed. I know I’d like to be remembered when I die, even if it’s just by one person. I reached out a hand to run my finger along the engraving, but I never quite got there as a pregnant lady came waddling towards me.<br>
<br>
I stepped back to let her sit and smiled at her, though she was far too busy wheezing to notice. A large part of me felt sorry for her, having to go for a walk alone while caring for a baby yet to be born. Where was the father? But another part of me was content – the cycle of life goes on: one life is lost, and another is gained. Her breathing became more ragged, and I started to fear the worst but thankfully she reached into her bag and pulled out an asthma inhaler. After taking a few puffs from it, she relaxed back onto George’s bench and breathed a few simple breaths.<br>
<br><br>
I walked past the bench again today, but this time I found a couple of young children: a boy and a girl. I presumed they must be really close friends because the boy was picking hairs off his smaller, more irate counterpart who was retaliating through carefully aimed jabs to his arm. I found myself giggling in childlike wonder along with them, remembering what it was like to be that young and carefree. Their biggest priority wasn’t getting a job nor finding someone to love – it was figuring out how best to wind up your friends. I heard two mothers call their names and I turned to see where the voices came from.<br>
<br>
When I turned back, a spotty young lad was reading on the bench. His glasses didn’t fit his face and he was clearly quite socially awkward. There was a sweet girl with pigtails who was sat on the other side of the bench. I saw her keep sneaking occasional glances at the boy, but he was so absorbed in his book he didn’t notice. The girl looked down at her feet and pulled out a small slip of paper, before standing up and walking in front of the boy, dropping it in his book. He certainly noticed then, but by the time he’d unfurled the piece of paper with her phone number on it, she was gone.<br>
<br><br>
I was quite taken aback when next I wandered that park and eyed the bench. The spotty young lad was there with a girl, but he was no longer spotty nor young. And the girl, her pigtails were now a short fluffy cut. Her eyes were closed as she lay along the seat, resting her head on the boy – no, man’s lap, with a thin smile spread across both of their faces. A sigh of relief worked its way out of my mouth as I was glad to see they were happy together.<br>
<br>
No-one was sat on the bench when I found myself walking past it again. A man in a rather bespoke suit jogged past me as I heard a yell from behind. The lady was not angry, she was calling out to the man as he’d forgotten his briefcase. But he didn’t hear her, he was too busy rushing to work, and could not afford to miss the bus. Begrudgingly, the woman pulled out her car keys and went to go deliver the briefcase to his workplace. The boss would not be happy with him not only showing up late, but for arriving without his documents. Once again, she would save the day.<br>
<br>
The woman was sat silently next to her husband this time. They did not talk and the smiles were gone from their faces. The man stared off into the middle distance as his wife snuck the occasional glance at him. He did not meet her face not because he didn’t realise, but because he wasn’t aware she was sat there. I knew deep down he missed her, he missed himself – but this cloud of darkness that shrouded him had evidently only grown greater over the last few years. “Veronica,” he whispered to himself, remembering just a little. I turned as I saw a single tear fall down her face.<br>
<br><br><br>
When I opened my eyes, they were both gone.<br>
<br><br><br>
Night fell and still there was no-one.<br>
<br><br><br>
Midnight came and finally an old woman came hobbling slowly down the path towards the bench. She placed her walking stick aside and rested her weary bones on the carved wood. It was not comfortable, but she didn’t seem to notice. ‘I don’t remember this,’ I thought. ‘This is after-’ I was interrupted by the old woman: “I never stopped thinking about you George,” she said. “To think all those years ago, we’d go on so many adventures together, just you and me.” She paused to catch her breath. “I love you, George.” She patted the bench and I stuck out my hand, but it went straight through hers. “I love you too, Veronica,” I let out as my vision began to blur with tears. Through this, I could still see the sun begin to rise as Veronica closed her eyes one last time.<br>
