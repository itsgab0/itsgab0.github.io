<div class="fancy poem">
At each turn the earth splits open,<br>
Spewing lava-sottered rock;<br>
Jutting up into the night sky,<br>
Mottled moonlight runs amok.<br>

See it dance around the stonework,<br>
Made on anvils mountain-high;<br>
Hammered by the gods of beauty,<br>
Set the moonlight free to fly.<br>

Ashes fall upon the beaches,<br>
Ice and snow fall on the fields,<br>
Moss grows tall on every surface,<br>
Moonlight scattered through the wealds.<br>

Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter,<br>
People speeding to and fro,<br>
Cycles ‘round but all things end,<br>
O’, dear moonlight, must you go?<br>
