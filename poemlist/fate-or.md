<div class="fancy poem" style="width:50%">
I wake and see her sitting<br>
in the corner of my room,<br>
She doesn't speak or look at me<br>
<span style="margin-left:10%">I hope I don't scare her.</span><br>

I wake and see her weaving<br>
in the corner of my room,<br>
The yarn is spun so carefully<br>
<span style="margin-left:10%">by her delicate hands.</span><br>

I wake and see her waiting<br>
in the corner of my room,<br>
The yarn is in a tangled mess<br>
<span style="margin-left:10%">on my messy floor.</span><br>

I wake but I don't see her<br>
in the corner of my room,<br>
My hands grow paler every day<br>
<span style="margin-left:10%">but still I go to sleep.</span><br>

I wake and see her look at me<br>
in wonder or confusion,<br>
Was it her who coiled the yarn?
<div style="text-align:right">Or did I let the threads slip</div>
<div style="text-align:right">from my hands.</div><br>
