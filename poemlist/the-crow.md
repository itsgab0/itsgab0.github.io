# The Crow

<div class="fancy poem">
Upon that scarlet evening<br>
The crow did make its call<br>
Fear strikes as all alight<br>
They see him standing tall<br>

Why has he come, who is he for?<br>
The villagers want to know<br>
Their clamouring is silenced<br>
By the calling of the crow<br>

Upon that dreaded evening<br>
The children all fell mute<br>
Sweet lullabilies; their brains' demise<br>
Watched mothers absolute<br>

Men cried out and brandished blades<br>
But powerless to stop it<br>
His eyes did glaze through empty haze<br>
As lo their brains were rotted<br>

As dawn sprung from the evening<br>
He left that place in tow<br>
The devil-spawn in whatever form<br>
Is followed by the crow<br>
