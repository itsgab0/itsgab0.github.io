# Righteous Vengeance

<div class="cd smcp">Gabe Foad â€” iii.2023</div>

<div class="fancy poem">
The living embers leapt and bound before his eyes of grey,<br>
when suddenly a spectre formed right out the flaming fray.<br>
As all around the town burned down and crumbled into ash,<br>
a little child, a boy or girl, revealed within a flash.<br>

They turned and looked straight through his soul to deign it good or bad,<br>
and said, "I see a troubled child; a woeful past of sad"<br>
Then eerily they stopped and smiled and then went on to say:<br>
"But evil you are not and so it's alright, it's O.K."<br>

As flames died down, a mem'ry stirred, with screaming just outside,<br>
as mother held him closely, hugging tighter over time.<br>
His father's voice was beaten down by brutes until 'twas quiet,<br>
while vision through the crack revealed a flame that slowly died.<br>

Perhaps he should've died that day, it had to have been better,<br>
than the monster he'd become in the pursuit of father's debtors.<br>
The ones who'd wronged his family now laid down by the raid,<br>
Perhaps he had died; though anticipation steeped his blade.<br>
