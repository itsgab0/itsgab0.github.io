# Stagnation

<div class="cd smcp">Gabe Foad â€” v.2024</div>

<div class="fancy poem">
Out back I have a little puddle,<br>
Gifted from my parents,<br>
I add a splash 'most every day,<br>
Rewarding perseverance.<br>

My puddle grew into a pond,<br>
Which swelled into a pool,<br>
But I let it fell stagnant,<br>
And the blame falls to the fool.<br>

The first thought isn't 'get it clean',<br>
But 'recognise my guilt',<br>
How could I let it get this bad,<br>
Is failure just inbuilt?<br>

Then algal bloom attacks the pool,<br>
While I attack myself,<br>
Then comes the shame of feeling guilty,<br>
Cyclic worsened health.<br>

By now the water's all dried up,<br>
I fear that I'm the same.<br>
