# Stellar Admiration

<div class="cd smcp">Gabe Foad â€” i.2023</div>

<div class="fancy poem">
We look up to the star-shot skies<br>
and ponder on the silence,<br>
when each bright spark up there belies<br>
whole galaxies of vibrance.<br>

Around the specks spin planets fierce,<br>
whose light takes years to reach us.<br>
Just thinking of the magnitude's<br>
enough to leave me speechless.<br>

So when I look up in the night<br>
and question if I'm lonely,<br>
A trillion friends of earth and light<br>
make life a tad more homely.<br>
