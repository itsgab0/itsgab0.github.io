# Afraid of Shame

<div class="cd smcp">Gabe Foad — i.2023</div>

<div class="fancy poem">
I see in them the sweet and tender love of life<br>
inside the mixed façades of splendour suffered time<br>
The candid sad of those whose embers cover strife<br>
Some amble languid; mists attendant smother mine<br>

Each walks a path so different from their neighbour's track<br>
Yet fights to struggle or outrun a crooked past<br>
And just to take a decent sum off nature's back<br>
When fear is reason number one to hide our acts<br>

'Tis human nature resting in the hands of youth<br>
We rise and proudly wear cursed minds of sands escaped<br>
And so, by speaking out; profound commands the truth<br>
We find the stars shine brighter on the strands of fate
