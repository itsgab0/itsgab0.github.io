      <p>For reasons that can only be attributed to insanity, the author spent several months trawling the entirety of Wikipedia (a very reputable source) for <b>every</b> language that had more than 1,000 recorded speakers (Native and L2 combined).</p>
      
      <p>With regards to the reliability of Wikipedia, it should be noted that for languages with more than 1 million speakers the claims were verified with <b>Ethnologue</b>, but those below are of potentially dubious claims. If a language is claimed to have a significant quantity of speakers between 1,000 and 1 million, it has been assumed to be correct.</p>
      
      <p>The author has attempted to acquire some interesting facts about Language Families. In doing so, there has been created a document containing hand-transcribed names of 4054 languages ordered by hierarchical language family trees and their vague number of speakers.</p>
      
      <div class="bar"><br/></div>
      
      <p>Ethnologue states there are 7,151 living languages, so with this very rudimentary count of 4054 languages with more than 1,000 speakers, there must be roughly 3,097 languages with fewer than 1,000 speakers. The value of 4054 includes the 370 above, and the value of 370 includes the 2 above that. All values on this page should not be taken as exact numbers due to the fallible nature of this exercise, and should be treated as <b>ball-park figures</b> instead.</p>
      
      <p>In total, 139 Language Families met the criteria set out beforehand, that is, having at least one language with more than 1,000 speakers. Unfortunately, this left out many languages; the justification being twofold: 1) The author wanted to leave this ordeal alive, and 2) Due to the uncertain nature of exact numbers, the smaller they got the less verifiable they became, and the higher the likelihood was that certain languages that seemed alive as of the last census had since gone extinct.</p>

      <p>The language family with the <b>Highest Ratio of Languages with >1 Million Speakers</b> is:</p>
      
      <div class="indent"><p><em>BASQUE</em></p></div>
      
      <p>This is due to the fact that Basque is a language isolate - no other languages are traceable as a relative of it. Additionally, it's the only language isolate with over a million speakers.</p>
      
      <br/><div class="bar"></div>
      
      <h3>Oddball Facts</h3>
      
      <p>The author could only find evidence of <b>1</b> language family containing a language whose English names started with every single letter of the English alphabet. That language family was Afroasiatic. In no specific order nor preference, what follows is just one example for each letter:</p>
      
      <div class="indent"><p><b>Arabic, Beja, Cibak, Dirasha, Eastern Oromo, Fyer, Gamo-Gofa-Dawro, Hebrew, Iraqw, Jara, Karai-Karai, Lagwan, Mozabite, Ngwaba, Oromo, Parkwa, Qimant, Ron, Somali, Tigrinya, Ubi, Vame, Wolaitta, Xamtanga, Yiwom, Zay</b></p></div>
      
      <p>What this represents is uncertain as the names differ between English and their native tongues. Some language families came close but for just one or two letters, such as Niger-Congo and Sino-Tibetan/Tibeto-Burman; the latter even had a significant number of languages above 1 Million Speakers per letter, but failed to provide an example of one beginning with 'I'.</p>
      
      <div class="bar"></div>
      
      <p>Another thing of note is <b>Japanese</b> and <b>Korean</b>, which the author had presumed to be language isolates.</p>
      
      <p>However within the <b>Japonic</b> language family lies several other languages, named the <b>Ryukyuan Languages</b>, such as:</p>
      
      <ul class="list">
        <li><b>Okinawan</b> - spoken by around 100,000 people on Okinawa Island</li>
        <li><b>Miyako</b> - spoken by around 50,000 people on the Miyako Islands</li>
        <li><b>Yaeyama</b> - spoken by around 50,000 people on the Yaeyama Islands</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>With, Korean, there isn't a huge amount of languages left in the <b>Koreanic</b> branch, as just one other survives:</p>
      
      <ul class="list">
        <li><b>Jeju</b> - spoken by around 5,000 people on Jeju Island</li>
      </ul>
