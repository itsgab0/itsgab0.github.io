      <span class="paragraphBlockHeader">What do you mean by "Analysis"?</span>
      
      <p>For reasons that can only be attributed to insanity, the author spent several months trawling the entirety of Wikipedia (a very reputable source) for <b>every</b> language that had more than 1,000 recorded speakers (Native and L2).</p>
      
      <p class="indentParagraph">With regards to the reliability of Wikipedia, it should be noted that for languages with more than 1 million speakers the claims were verified with Ethnologue, but those below are of potentially dubious claims. If a language is claimed to have a significant quantity of speakers between 1,000 and 1 million, it has been assumed to be correct.</p>
      
      <p>As such, the author has collected some interesting tidbits about Languages and Language Families, and has thus compiled them into this one page. (Yes there exists a document containing hand-transcribed names of 4054 languages, the author has very poor computational skills).</p>
      
      <p class="indentParagraph">Ethnologue states there are 7,151 living languages, so with this very rudimentary count of 4049 languages with more than 1,000 speakers, there must be roughly 3,097 languages with fewer than 1,000 speakers. The value of 4054 includes the 370 above, and the value of 370 includes the 2 above that. All values on this page should not be taken as exact numbers due to the fallible nature of this exercise, and should be treated as <b>ball-park figures</b> instead.</p>
      
      <p>In total, 139 Language Families met the criteria set out beforehand, that is, having at least one language with more than 1,000 speakers. Unfortunately, this left out many languages; the justification being twofold: 1) The author wanted to leave this ordeal alive, and 2) Due to the uncertain nature of exact numbers, the smaller they got the less verifiable they became, and the higher the likelihood was that certain languages that seemed alive as of the last census had since gone extinct.</p>

      <p>The author could only find evidence of <b>1</b> language family containing a language whose English names started with every single letter of the English alphabet. That language family was Afroasiatic. In no specific order nor preference, what follows is just one example for each letter:</p>
      
      <p class=indentParagraph>Arabic, Beja, Cibak, Dirasha, Eastern Oromo, Fyer, Gamo-Gofa-Dawro, Hebrew, Iraqw, Jara, Karai-Karai, Lagwan, Mozabite, Ngwaba, Oromo, Parkwa, Qimant, Ron, Somali, Tigrinya, Ubi, Vame, Wolaitta, Xamtanga, Yiwom, Zay</p>
      
      <p>What this represents is uncertain as the names differ between English and their native tongues. Some language families came close but for just one or two letters, such as Niger-Congo and Sino-Tibetan/Tibeto-Burman; the latter even had a significant number of languages above 1 Million Speakers per letter, but failed to provide an example of one beginning with 'I'.</p>
