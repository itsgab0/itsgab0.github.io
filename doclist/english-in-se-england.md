# English in South East England

<br>

## Introduction to English

Today, English is spoken in every continent, and as of 2023, had almost 1.5 billion speakers worldwide<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> — meaning if you were to take any one human being on the planet at random, there’s an 18% chance they would speak English. Modern English traces its roots to the Germanic language(s) spoken by the various Germanic tribes that invaded and settled in Great Britain from the 5th century onwards.

The language as we know it today is very different from that spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, and so linguists generally distinguish 4 major periods of English:

- **Old English** — (5th – 11th c.)
- **Middle English** — (11th – 15th c.)
- **Early Modern English** — (15th – 17th c.)
- **Modern English** — (17th c. – pres.)

However, a language is not a wholly singular monolith – varying between regions or social groups. Very roughly, if the differences are solely in pronunciation, they are 'accents'; if they have elements of unique grammar and slang terms, they are 'dialects'.

## Historical English in South East England

During the Anglo-Saxon period (ca. 5th – 11th c.), four major dialects of Old English are recognised, each centred around eponymous kingdoms: **Northumbrian** (Northumbria – most of northern England and some of southern Scotland); **Mercian** (Mercia – most of central England); **West Saxon** (Wessex – most of southeastern and southern England); and **Kentish** (Kent).

The supremacy of the Kingdom of Wessex established Old English (Wessex dialect) as the literary language of England – until the Normans invaded and established their Norman varieties of Old French that developed into 'Anglo-Norman' – leaving Old English to the common people.

Over time, the Norman influence on the language of government waned, and the midlands' Mercian dialect formed the basis of Middle English (ca. 11th – 15th); during this time, the last remnants of the Kentish dialect died out. The accent of London and its environs began to increasingly diverge from its neighbours: the West Country and the Midlands.

Today, the 'prestige'-associated form of English in the UK developed from the London accent, commonly called **Received Pronunciation** (RP). The London accent was where the long 'a' sound in "bath" diverged from the traditionally short 'a' sound in "trap" – the two words still have the same vowel in northern English accents.

## Modern English in South East England

Modern scholars are increasingly pushing to distinguish 'RP' and today's standard form of southern English – which is markedly different to the speech of the upper classes two centuries ago. The older form has been labelled 'Oxford English', 'Heightened RP', and 'Conservative RP'; while the modern form has been called 'General British', 'Non-Regional Pronunciation', or simply 'RP'.

The International Phonetic Association (IPA) reserves 'RP' for the traditional variety, and its successor is referred to by the term 'Standard Southern British' (SSB):

> *Standard Southern British* (where 'Standard' should not be taken as implying a value judgement of 'correctness') is the modern equivalent of what has been called *'Received Pronunciation'* ('RP'). It is an accent of the south east of England which operates as a prestige norm there and (to varying degrees) in other parts of the British Isles and beyond.

The 'standard' variety of English is generally associated with higher social status, resulting in working class forms being associated with lesser social prestige.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> Outlined below are 5 major varieties of English in South East England:

- [**Received Pronunciation**](#received-pronunciation--rp) (Traditional Upper Class)
- [**Standard Southern British**](#standard-southern-british--ssb) (Upper-Middle / Middle Class)
- [**Estuary English**](#estuary-english--ee) (Middle / Lower-Middle Class)
- [**Multicultural London English**](#multicultural-london-english--mle) (Emergent Working Class)
- [**Cockney**](#cockney) (Traditional Working Class)

Each variant is shown with a number of famous speakers and a non-comprehensive number of noticeable phonological features distinct from other varieties. Finally, a 2023 study of English speakers from South East England by the University of Essex (hereafter, unofficially 'SEE-23') analysed and categorised the speech of ~200 'young people' (aged 18 – 33)<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> – values associated with prevalence can be considered roughly indicative of the current status of each form. 

## Received Pronunciation – (RP)

- **Famous Speakers:**
  - <span class="gp">**King** Charles III (b. 1948), **Dame** Judi Dench (b. 1934), **Sir** David Attenborough (b. 1926)</span>

‘RP’ is a term now commonly used to describe the accent of older nobility and aristocracy, or the upper classes in general. The name suggests the accent was ‘received’ – i.e., accepted or understood – by all speakers of English. RP developed from the 18th/19th century accent of London, particularly within the ‘Golden Triangle’ bounded by the university cities of London, Oxford, and Cambridge. RP has been mostly replaced by SSB.

**SEE-23** identified no speakers of RP amongst young people in South East England.

- **Notable Features:**
  - The vowel in "time" starts like the 'a' in "tap", not the 'a' in "far".
    - <span class="gp">Front /ɑɪ/ — ⟨time⟩ = [taɪm]</span>
  - The vowel in "choice" starts like the 'o' in "lot", not the 'o' in "for".
    - <span class="gp">Low /oɪ/ — ⟨choice⟩ = [tʃɔɪs]</span>
  - The vowel in "house" starts like the 'u' in "hut", not the 'a' in "cat".
    - <span class="gp">Front \& Unrounded /aʊ/ — ⟨house⟩ = [hɐɤs]</span>
  - The final vowel in "happy" is like the 'i' in "kit", not the 'ee' in "teen".
    - <span class="gp">No 'happy tensing' — ⟨happy⟩ = [ˈhæ.pɪ]</span>

## Standard Southern British – (SSB)

- **Famous Speakers:**
  - <span class="gp">**Prince** Harry (b. 1984), Tilda Swinton (b. 1960), Hugh Laurie (b. 1959)</span>

‘SSB’ is a recently-defined term for the modern ‘prestige accent’ of British English. In most contexts, SSB has effectively replaced RP and SSB is not perceived to be as 'posh' as RP. As the current ‘prestige form’ of British English, the notable features are less national, and more so within a global and historical context.

**SEE-23** identified SSB in 40% of young people in South East England.

- **Notable Features:**
  - The 't' in "what" is like the gap in "uh-oh", not the 't' in "tap".
    - <span class="gp">Final glottal replacement — ⟨what⟩ = [wɔʔ]</span>
  - The vowel in "cure" is like the 'o' in "ore", not the 'oer' in "doer".
    - <span class="gp">/ɪə, eə, ʊə/-monophthongisation — ⟨cure⟩ = [kʲoː]</span>
  - The final vowel in "kindness" is like the 'a' in "comma", not the 'e' in "set".
    - <span class="gp">Unstressed /ɛ/-reduction — ⟨kindness⟩ = [ˈkɑɪnʔ.nəs]</span>

## Estuary English – (EE)

- **Famous Speakers:**
  - <span class="gp">Jamie Oliver (b. 1975), Adele (b. 1988), Ricky Gervais (b. 1961)</span>

‘EE’ is a term for the emerging accent of South East England, demonstrating features traditionally associated with both RP and Cockney. The name refers to the Thames Estuary, as the accent is significantly evidence in London and the home counties in contact with the River Thames. EE is difficult to pin down, with some placing it in the middle of a theoretical continuum from RP to Cockney, while others label it a ‘generalisation’ or ‘folk category’.

**SEE-23** identified EE in 26% of young people in South East England.

- **Notable Features:**
  - The 'l' in "real" is like the 'w' in "wit", not the 'l' in "lap".
    - <span class="gp">/l/-vocalisation — ⟨real⟩ = [rɪw]</span>
  - The 'tu' in "tune" starts like the 'ch' in "chip", not the 'tia' in "Tiananmen".
    - <span class="gp">Yod-coalescence — ⟨tune⟩ = [tʃuːn]</span>
  - The vowel in "house" is like the 'a' in "mass", not the 'ow' in "down".
    - <span class="gp">/aʊ/-raising — ⟨house⟩ = [haːs]</span>

## Multicultural London English – (MLE)

- **Famous Speakers:**
  - <span class="gp">Stormzy (b. 1993), NoLay (b. 1985), Michael Dapaah (b. 1991)</span>

‘MLE’ is a term for the very recently-emerging multiethnolect of the London area, with a heavy representation bias towards younger speakers (aged ~35 and below), from mainly working class backgrounds. The name refers to the varied origins of the accent as centred around London; the core of MLE is the older Cockney dialect, with significant phonological and vocabulary influence from the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia. MLE, as an ethnolect, displays variant phonology, vocabulary, and grammar – representative of an ethnic in-group. 

**SEE-23** identified MLE in 25% of young people in South East England.

- **Notable Features:**
  - The 'k' in "look" is like the Arabic 'q' in "Iraq", not the 'c' in "cat".
    - <span class="gp">/k/-backing — ⟨look⟩ = [lʊq]</span>
  - The 'th' in "through" is like the 'f' in "fish", not the 'th' in "pith".
    - <span class="gp">th-fronting — ⟨through⟩ = [fɹuː]</span>
  - The 'th' in "thing" may be like the 't' in "tag" *OR* the 'f' in "fun", not the 'th' in "wrath".
    - <span class="gp">th-stopping — ⟨thing⟩ = [tɪŋ]</span>
    - <span class="gp">th-fronting — ⟨thing⟩ = [fɪŋ]</span>
  - The 'th' in "this" may be like the 'd' in "dot" *OR* the 'v' in "van", not the 'th' in "these".
    - <span class="gp">dh-stopping — ⟨this⟩ = [dɪs]</span>
    - <span class="gp">dh-fronting — ⟨this⟩ = [vɪs]</span>

## Cockney

- **Famous Speakers:**
  - <span class="gp">**Sir** Michael Caine (b. 1933), Stacey Solomon (b. 1989), Idris Elba (b. 1971)</span>

‘Cockney’ is a term for the well-established dialect of the London area, most strongly around the East End and its working class culture. The name originated as a pejorative by 16th century rural Englishmen who labelled city-dwellers as pampered and by extension effeminate; by the 17th century, the term began to refer specifically to the Bow Bells area. The rise in MLE speakers indicates a shift away from the older Cockney, which is more highly evidenced in older Londoners. Cockney has a number of non-standard terms and grammar, perhaps most notably the 19th century cant, *'Cockney Rhyming Slang'*, wherein speakers generate slang words through rhymes – the most distinct examples have come to omit the rhyming part: e.g., "use your loaf" means "use your head", as 'head' rhymes with 'loaf \[of bread\]'

**SEE-23** identified no speakers of Cockney amongst young people in South East England.

- **Notable Features:**
  - The 'l's in "Millwall" are like the 'w' in "win", not the 'l' in "lip".
    - <span class="gp">dark-l-vocalisation — ⟨Millwall⟩ = [ˈmɪo.wɔo]</span>
  - The 'h' in "happy" is not pronounced.
    - <span class="gp">h-dropping — ⟨happy⟩ = [ˈ(ʔ)æʔ.piː]</span>
  - The 't' in "utter" is like the 't' in 'top', not the 't' in "cat".
    - <span class="gp">intervocalic \& initial /p, t, k/-aspiration — ⟨utter⟩ = [ˈaʔ.tʰə]</span>
  - The 'th' in "thing" is like the 'f' in "fun", not the 'th' in "wrath".
    - <span class="gp">th-fronting — ⟨thing⟩ = [fɪŋ]</span>
  - The 'th' in "they" is like the 'd' in "dot", not the 'th' in "these".
    - <span class="gp">initial dh-stopping — ⟨this⟩ = [dɪs]</span>
  - The vowel in "coat" starts like the 'u' in "hut", not the 'a' in "comma".
    - <span class="gp">Lowered /əʊ/ — ⟨coat⟩ = [kɐɤʔ]</span>
