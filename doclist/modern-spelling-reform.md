# A Modern Spelling Reform

<br>

## Introduction

Humans have been capable of speech for around 70 000 years,<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> but we have only been writing things down for 5 500 years.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> To facilitate communication, we convert ideas into a jumble of sounds recognisable to listeners. Effectively, the sounds used to embody any one concept are arbitrary – there is no discernible reason as to why 'an apple' to one shouldn't be 'una manzana' to another.

There is evidence to suggest that some sounds evoke certain imagery,<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> but the sheer variety in words to describe the same concept suggest sound symbolism is not a hard-and-fast rule. So why should any certain word be spelt the way that it is? Or rather, 'spelled' — as is more common in the United States. This variation can and does happen between accents and dialects of language, including English.

There is no defined standard of English, which lacks a governing body equivalent to the Spanish *Real Academia Española* or the French *L'Académie française*. As such, there is little consensus between dialects — the closest thing to standards is designating groups of dialects by theoretical or actual prestige variants. For UK English-speakers, this is Received Pronunciation (RP) or the more modern Standard Southern British (SSB); for US speakers, this is known as General American (GA).

These prestige varieties are generally non-regional, for instance, there are very few native speakers of RP/SSB, and it is suggested that younger speakers make special effort to include dialectal aspects due to a reduced perceived necessity of speaking "perfect" English.<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a>

Furhermore, spelling rarely accommodates dialectal differences; in fact, during the *Early Modern English* Period (ca. 1500 – 1700),<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> English *orthography* (spelling) was incredibly inconsistent. For example, the famous playwright *William Shakespeare* spelt his name dozens of different ways thoughout his life: *"Shakespere"*, *"Shackspeare"*, *"Shaxper"*, etc.<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a>

## Spelling and Spelling Reform

### Introduction to Spelling

So-called *phonemic orthopgraphies* have a near-or-complete correspondence between spelling and pronunciation — allowing users to accurately pronounce words they've never heard before based on the way they're written. In discussing speech sounds, the author makes frequent use of the *'International Phonetic Alphabetic'* (*IPA*), which is written in the Latin script and incorporates special symbols and accents to represent theoretically any speech sound along with stress patterns, pitch-tones, etc. Transcriptions between slashes are *'broad'*, while those between square brackets are *'narrow'*, e.g., *⟨ebbed⟩* · /ɛbd/ · \[ʔɛb̚d̥\].

Written Spanish is a generally phonemic orthography, and to illustrate this, herein follows an exercise:

- **'a fruit'** is *'una fruta'*, pronounced /ˌu.na ˈfɾu.ta/. How then would one pronounce *'una trufa'* (**'a truffle'**)? A breakdown of the spelling and associated sounds (ignoring stress) can be made:

| ⟨u⟩ | ⟨n⟩ | ⟨a⟩ | | ⟨f⟩ | ⟨r⟩ | ⟨u⟩ | ⟨t⟩ | ⟨a⟩ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
/u/ | /n/ | /a/ | | /f/ | /ɾ/ | /u/ | /t/ | /a/

- Therefore, one can rearrange the sounds to get /ˌu.na ˈtɾu.fa/.

Written English is less unambiguous, perfectly illustrated in a famous thought experiment first shown in an unpublished letter from Charles Ollier to Leigh Hunt.<a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> Per their instructions, we must take the following words and their pronunciations, the important sections being in bold and underlined:

| ⟨tou<span class="emul">gh</span>⟩ | ⟨w<span class="emul">o</span>men⟩ | ⟨men<span class="emul">ti</span>on⟩ |
| --- | --- | --- |
/tʌ<span class="emul">f</span>/ | /ˈw<span class="emul">ɪ</span>.mən/ | /ˈmɛn.<span class="emul">ʃ</span>ən/

- If we assemble the highlighted letters to make a word, and sounds to make its pronunciation, we get **'ghoti'**, pronounced /fɪʃ/ (**fish** — 🐟).

### Problems with English Spelling

- *Multigraphs are indistinguishable across syllables.*

  - E.g., ⟨thre<span class="emul">sh</span>⟩ · /θɹɛʃ/ vs. ⟨mi<span class="emul">sh</span>ap⟩ · /ˈmɪs.hap/

- *Split digraphs influence vowel sounds without touching.*

  - E.g., ⟨m<span class="emul">a</span>d⟩ · /mad/ vs. ⟨m<span class="emul">a</span>d<span class="emul">e</span>⟩ · /meɪd/

- *Multigraphs can contain several letters despite producing a single sound.*

  - E.g., ⟨Nie<span class="emul">tzsch</span>e⟩ · /ˈniː.<span class="emul">tʃ</span>ə/

- *Inconsistent sound changes (e.g., palatalisation, labialisation).*

  - E.g., ⟨h<span class="emul">u</span>m⟩ · /h<span class="emul">ʌ</span>m/ vs. ⟨h<span class="emul">u</span>mming⟩ · /h<span class="emul">ʌ</span>.mɪŋ/ vs. ⟨h<span class="emul">u</span>man⟩ · /h<span class="emul">juː</span>.mən/

- *Inconsistent stress.*

  - E.g., ⟨<span class="emul">u</span>nionised⟩ · /<span class="emul">ˈjuː</span>.njə.naɪzd/ vs. ⟨un<span class="emul">i</span>onised⟩ · /ˌʌn<span class="emul">ˈaɪ</span>.ə.naɪzd/

- *Low spelling-to-sound correspondence.*

  - E.g., ⟨-ough-⟩ ⟶ /ʌf, ɒf, aʊ, əʊ, ɔː, uː, ə, ʌp, ɒk, ɒx/

- *Redundant letters can be expressed by other letters or letter combinations.*

  - E.g., ⟨<span class="emul">x</span>⟩ · /ks, z/ · ⟨ks, z⟩

- *Digraphs are inconsistent with phonetic gemination.*

  - E.g., ⟨bi<span class="emul">dd</span>er⟩ · /ˈbɪ.<span class="emul">d</span>ə/ vs. ⟨mi<span class="emul">dd</span>ay⟩ · /mɪ<span class="emul">dˈd</span>eɪ/

### Problems with Spelling Reform

In no particular order, a number of advantages and disadvantages of spelling reform are:

| *Advantages* | *Disadvantages* |
| --- | --- |
Multigraphs could be simplified | May erode historical/etymological roots<a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a>
Phonetic spelling is already common when transcribing dialects | Difficult to account for accents and dialects
There have been several reforms already<a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> | Can range from mild changes to severe changes (potentially disturbing the literate population)<a href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a>
Redundant letters could be replaced | Number of English sounds exceeds basic Latin alphabet<a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a>

Joseph Benjamin Rundell, a proponent of spelling reform, gave a number of benefits and rebuttals to some of the perceived disadvantages:<a href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a>

- "Changing the spelling alters the language no more than changing a man's dress alters the man"

- Those knowledgeable enough to benefit from etymological roots in words would also benefit from the sounds in phonetic spelling

- The present spelling is often misleading wrt. etymology, and a phonetic spelling could better reflect the actual history

### Previous Suggestions

There are countless examples of spelling reform for English, each with a set of unique aims and features. The greatest visual distinction is most certainly in the use of new letters, or adding diacritics to existing letters. If no new letters have been added in a system, it is often called a *'respelling'*, with an emphasis on re-arranging and redefining existing letters and combinations under a novel framework.

Dictionaries will often use a proprietary respelling system, within the framework of a specific accent or dialect. For instance, the English-based *Oxford English Dictionary* transcribes pronunciation for a British English accent, though /ɹ/ is still included in syllable-final positions, despite RP/SSB being non-rhotic — e.g., the pronunciation of *'yearn'* is given as (yern).<a href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a>

Some systems incorporate non-English characters, though they could have historical or linguistic precedent, as in George Withers' system, which uses ⟨ŋ⟩ for the /ŋ/ sound, typically written ⟨ng⟩ in English.<a href="#fn16"><sup>16</sup></a> Ronald Kingsley Read's *'Shavian'* alphabet uses a completely novel set of symbols to represent the sounds of English, and has been revised and adapted numerous times.<a href="#fn17"><sup>17</sup></a>

## Modern Spelling Reform

### Accents and Dialects: The Arbitrary Clout Factor (ACF)

With the international spread of English comes a number of increasing differences between the vernaculars of various regions or peoples; the spelling of certain words may better reflect a more consistent system for one accent, and be completely jumbled for another.

The solution was obvious: create a completely arbitrary metric by which to 'rank' dialects and utilise this to work towards a phonemic orthography. The ACF evaluates the percentage of a population that speaks English against the actual English-speaking population to generate a value. This means that countries with many English speakers or a high percentage of English speakers will rank highly, but a combination of both derives the highest clout.

For example, a country like Uganda has ~ 20 mn. English speakers, but they only represent ~ 60 % of the population; meanwhile Zimbabwe has only ~ 14 mn. speakers, but they represent ~ 90 % of the population, hence Zimbabwe would have a higher ACF value than Uganda.

<!-- LaTeX: ACF = 100 \times \frac{Population \times Percentage}{Population + Percentage} -->

The five highest calculated ACF values — which also are the only five with a value over 80 — are as follows:

| Country | English Speakers (m) | Speaker Makeup (%) | ACF | Prestige Dialect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
United Kingdom*<br><a href="#fn18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20"><sup>20</sup></a> | 63.6 | 98.3 | 97 | Standard Southern British
United States<br><a href="#fn21"><sup>21</sup></a> | 316 | 95.5 | 95 | General American
Australia<br><a href="#fn22"><sup>22</sup></a> | 21.7 | 92.8 | 89 | Australian English
Zimbabwe<br><a href="#fn23"><sup>23</sup></a> | 14.4 | 90.0 | 85 | Zimbabwean English
Canada<br><a href="#fn24"><sup>24</sup></a> | 30.5 | 86.2 | 84 | Canadian English

- \* The United Kingdom performs a census as three entities: *England and Wales*, *Scotland*, and *Northern Ireland*.

## Reformed Orthography

### Initial Attempt

The orthography of the Modern Spelling Reform at first made use of the basic Latin alphabet, with the addition of 4 Latinate characters (Ð, Ɵ, Ŋ, and Ʌ). At this stage, the MSR alphabet had 31 graphemes, employed 3 diacritics, and maintained limited digraphs; the total number of *unique* phonemes was 45. In order to maximise viability, MSR at this stage prioritised preservation of graphs and some orthographic principles.

The standard length of the English alphabet is *26 letters*, however the Latin alphabet had only *23 letters*, wherein ⟨I⟩ encoded ⟨I, J⟩, and ⟨V⟩ encoded ⟨U, V, W⟩.<a href="#fn25"><sup>25</sup></a> For comparison, the table below illustrates the lengths of the alphabets used in the most-spoken languages of Europe:<a href="#fn26"><sup>26</sup></a>

| Language | Alphabet Class | Alphabet Length |
| --- | --- | --- |
*Russian* | Cyrillic | 33
*German* | Latin | 30
*French* | Latin | 26
*Turkish* | Latin | 29
*Italian* | Latin | 21
*English* | Latin | 26
*Spanish* | Latin | 27
*Polish* | Latin | 32
*Ukrainian* | Cyrillic | 33
*Dutch* | Latin | 26

- The mean and median alphabet length of the above languages is *28 letters*. However, the 31 graphemes were unwieldy, and maintained poor consistency with some of the high-ACF phonologies, so the next step was to evaluate the current state of English.

### Development — Current English

Predicting an abhorrent product, an attempt to evaluate the current state of English included the tabulation of real orthographic examples with the highest correspondence between spelling and predictability. In the table below, the required diaphonemes (generalised cross-dialectal IPA symbol) are shown along with a graphemic equivalent, along with an English counterexample (if it exists).

| Lexical Set | Diaphoneme | Grapheme | Example | Counterexample | Counter Sound |

To demonstrate the system defined above, Article 1 from the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been copied and transcribed as follows:

- All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

- Aahl hyoeumahn beeingz arrh boarn free and eekwahl in dignitee and ruyts. Dhei arrh indaod widh reezahn and konshahns and shood akt tahwoardz wun ahnudhurr in ah spirit ahv brudhurrhood.

### Development — Consonants

The current iteration of MSR aims to maintain a 1-to-1 correspondence and minimise consonantal digraphs, as such, this necessitates the use of diacritics to effect some sound change. Palatalisation and velarisation (highly simplified: both are more 'backward' in the mouth) are currently shown via an *'overdot'*, partially for simplicity, and partially for distinction from other European languages, but a comparison of actual systems is shown below:

| Language | Grapheme | Phoneme | Grapheme | Phoneme |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
MSR | *c*, *s*, *z* | /ts, s, z/ | *ċ*, *ṡ*, *ż* | /tʃ, ʃ, ʒ/
Czech | *c*, *s*, *z* | /ts, s, z/ | *č*, *š*, *ž* | /tʃ, ʃ, ʒ/
German | *tz*, *ß* | /ts, s/ | *tsch*, *sch* | /tʃ, ʃ/
Hungarian | *c*, *sz*, *z* | /ts, s, z/ | *cs*, *s*, *zs* | /tʃ, ʃ, ʒ/
Italian | *zz*, *ss* | /t.ts, s.s/ | *ci*, *sci* | /tʃ, ʃ/
Polish | *c*, *s*, *z* | /ts, s, z/ | *ć*/*cz*, *ś*/*sz*, *ź*/*ż* | /tɕ/tʂ, ɕ/ʂ, ʑ/ʐ/
Turkish | *c*, *s*, *z* | /dʒ, s, z/ | *ç*, *ş*, *j* | /tʃ, ʃ, ʒ/

In terms of a phonemic orthography, over-inscription would always be preferable to under-inscription, as speakers can easily omit 'silent' letters or ignore certain diacritics; however, knowing to add extra sounds that aren't written may lead to confusion. Some orthographies manage, such as abjads, which omit all vowels and requires the speakers to be sufficiently intimate with the vocabulary so as to be able to overcome such a hurdle. Of course, English speakers naturally do this now — such as in the *'ough'* example shown above.

However, history provides some precedence for the dental consonants /ð, θ/, through the characters ⟨ð, þ⟩, which were used in Old English and were called *'ðæt'* and *'þorn'*. If complete consistency is required, two alternative systems utilising only dots, and only digraphs are shown below:

| Type | /tʃ/ | /ð/ | /ŋ/ | /ʃ/ | /θ/ | /ʒ/ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
MSR | ċ | ð | ṅ | ṡ | þ | ż
Alt. 1 | ċ | ḍ | ṅ | ṡ | ṭ | ż
Alt. 2 | ch | dh | ng | sh | th | zh

As such, the consonant inventory for MSR is as follows:

| Grapheme | Diaphoneme | Example | English |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
*b* | //b// | *b*lud | blood
*c* | //ts// | fi*c* | fits
*ċ* | //tʃ// | bæ*ċ* | batch
*d* | //d// | grë*d* | grade
*ð* | //ð// | e*ð* | edh
*f* | //f// | *f*ain | fine
*g* | //ɡ// | ba*g*in | begin
*h* | //h// | *h*únï | honey
*j* | //dʒ// | bæ*j* | badge
*k* | //k// | bë*k* | bake
*l* | //l// | *l*ain | line
*m* | //m// | *m*unþ | month
*n* | //n// | í*n*turn | intern
*ṅ* | //ŋ// | ki*ṅ* | king
*p* | //p// | skri*p*t | script
*q* | //x// | lo*q* | loch
*r* | //ɹ// | *r*ë | ray
*s* | //s// | ä*s*k | ask
*ṡ* | //ʃ// | fæ*ṡ*an | fashion
*t* | //t// | sóf*t*ur | softer
*þ* | //θ// | pä*þ* | path
*v* | //v// | ra*v*ïl | reveal
*w* | //w// | *w*osp | wasp

*y* | //j// | *y*es | yes
*z* | //z// | kwi*z* | quiz
*ż* | //ʒ// | mẅ́*ż*ik | muzhik

### Development — Vowels

The greatest variation between accents and dialects of English occurs in the vowels. 22 vowel sounds are coded for in MSR, and have been rendered into 4 categories:

- *Short* – short or monophthongal
- *Reducible* – mostly long or polyphthongal but reduced to 'short' equivalent in some cases
- *Irreducible* – long or polyphthongal
- *Rhotic* – 'r-coloured' or omissible rhotic vowel

#### Short Vowels

- Currently, unstressed ⟨a⟩ is frequently pronounced as the schwa sound.
- Therefore, the Old English ⟨æ⟩ (called *'æsċ'*) is used for the much less common /æ/ sound.
- The use of ⟨w⟩ as a vowel as well as a consonant is present in languages like Welsh, and is used to minimise the number of additional characters required.

| — | i | w | e | a | o | u | æ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Diaphoneme | //ɪ// | //ʊ// | //ɛ// | //ə// | //ɒ// | //ʌ// | //æ//
Phones | \[ɪ,ə,i\] | \[ɵ,ʊ,u\] | \[ɛ,e,i\] | \[ə,wa,a\] | \[ɔ,ɒ,ɑ,o\] | \[ʌ,a\] | \[a,æ,e\]

#### Reducible Vowels

- Many systems employ the macron (e.g., ⟨ē⟩) to illustrate long vowels, however the nature of the 'reducible' vowels necessitate a less strong alternative, and the diaeresis can be rationalised as a visually incomplete rendering of a macron.

| — | ï | ẅ | ë | ö | ä |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Diaphoneme | //iː// | //uː// | //eɪ// | //oʊ// | //ɑː//
Phones | \[ɪi,iː,i\] | \[ɪ̈ɨ,ʉʊ,u(ː),ɯ\] | \[ɛɪ,æɪ,e\] | \[əʉ,əʊ,oʊ,o\] | \[ɑː,ɐː,a\]

#### Irreducible Vowels

- There really is no current concise and consistent method of rendering the //ɔː// diaphoneme, some systems opt for a macron ⟨ō⟩, others inherit the Hellenic omega ⟨ω⟩, however this bears an almost indistinguishable similarity to ⟨w⟩ especially when read quickly, so the approximation of ⟨uo⟩ is suggested.

| — | oi | uo | ai | au |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Diaphoneme | //ɔɪ// | //ɔː// | //aɪ// | //aʊ//
Phones | \[oɪ,ɔɪ,o.ji\] | \[oː,ɔː,ɑː\] | \[ɑɪ,aɪ,a.ji\] | \[aʊ,æɔ,ɐʊ,a.wu\]

#### Rhotic Vowels

- As stated above, it is almost certainly preferable to over-inscribe than under-, and the truth is that the percentage of rhotic speakers of English necessitates the preservation of 'historic' ⟨r⟩, and non-rhotic speakers will just have to lump it.

| — | ir | wr | er | ur | or | ar |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Diaphoneme | //ɪər// | //ʊər// | //ɛər// | //ɜːr,ər// | //ɔːr// | //ɑːr//
Phones | \[ɪː,ɪə,ɪɚ,ɪɹ,ja\] | \[oː,uːɹ,ʊəɹ\] | \[ɛː,ɛɚ,eɪ.ɚ,e.j\] | \[əː,ɜː,ɜːɹ,ɝ,e\] | \[oː,ɔːɹ,ɑɹ\] | \[ɑː,ɑɹ,ɐː,a\]

### Development — Alphabet Summary

At this stage, the complete set of graphemes in an alphabetical order is as follows:

- A a Ä ä Ai ai Ar ar Au au Æ æ B b C c D d Ð ð E e Ë ë Er er F f G g H h I i Ï ï Ir ir J j K k L l M m N n Ṅ ṅ O o Ö ö Oi oi Or or P p Q q R r S s Ṡ ṡ T t Þ þ U u Ur ur V v W w Ẅ ẅ Wr wr X x Y y Z z Ż ż

MSR is characterised by *27 consonants* (23 glyphs + ◌̇) and *22 vowels* (7 glyphs + ◌̈), totalling:

- **30** *Glyphs* + **2** *Diacritics* ⟶ **49** *Graphemes*

The 30 glyphs means MSR boasts a larger orthography than most Germanic and Romance languages, but one still smaller than most Slavic languages. Additionally, this set of characters presents a more consistent cross-dialectal approach than the initial attempt, allowing for a consistent conversion of current pronunciation into a phonemic MSR equivalent that is regular for each of the high-ACF phonologies.

Finally, if a completely phonemic orthography is desired (as is used in the sample texts), an acute accent (e.g., ⟨é⟩) can be used to mark stress, however general phonemic principles apply: polysyllablic words with schwa syllables won't usually need to mark stress, monosyllables won't need to mark internal stress, etc.

## Sample Texts
