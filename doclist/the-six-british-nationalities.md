# The Six British Nationalities

<br>

## Nationality and Citizenship

According to the Office for National Statistics, **Citizenship** reflects 'a person's formal membership of a state', while **Nationality** reflects 'an individual's choice to become a citizen, as well as their ability and eligibility to do so'.<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> Furthermore, a person's **national identity** reflects their own sense of belonging to one or more nations.

- For example, according to the 2021 Census of England and Wales<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>:

| %age | National Identity |
| --- | :--- |
54.8% | **"British"** only
14.9% | **"English"** only
13.6% | **"English"** and **"British"**
3.2% | **"Welsh"** only
0.6% | **"Welsh"** and **"British"**

Modern British **citizenship** is the product of a complicated history of *kingdoms*, *imperialism*, and *colonialism*, however the decline of the British Empire and support for decolonisation, both domestically and abroad, during the early-mid 20th century is an important starting point. Before *1949*, almost everyone within the *British Empire* held **British Subject** status, effectively equivalent to contemporary **British Citizen** status.

After *1949*, any child born in the *United Kingdom* and any associated territories (except for the *Dominions* — later, *Commonwealth countries* — who created their own citizenship legislation) was automatically made a **Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies** (CUKC).<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>

Then, in *1973*, **CUKC**s had their right of abode in the UK and its territories either affirmed or denied.<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> This mainly affirmed such a right in those born in the UK, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, and the Crown Dependencies. Finally, in *1983*, British nationality was separated into 6 different variants that are still recognised today which, as a minimum, grant entitlement to British consular assistance and a British passport.<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a>

## The Six British Nationalities

- **British Citizen**: The 'standard' form of British nationality, granting entitlement to habitation and occupation in the UK without immigration controls.

- **British Overseas Territories Citizen** (BOTC): (*Formerly, 'British Dependent Territories Citizen'*) Generally held by those born in a British overseas territory with at least one parent or grandparent that holds such a nationality. Since 2002, almost every BOTC dually holds British citizenship (except for those associated with Akrotiri and Dhekelia).<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a>

The following nationalities are not recognised abroad as 'British nationals':

- **British Overseas Citizen** (BOC): Generally held by those born in a former British colony or territory that had ceded the British Empire before 1984.

- **British Subject**: Generally held by those born in a British territory before 1949 but did not qualify for any other citizenship, and those given Irish citizenship in 1949 who explicitly requested to remain a 'British subject'.

- **British National (Overseas)**: Held by BOTCs connected with Hong Kong prior to the handover to China, granting eligiblity towards a BN(O) visa.

- **British Protected Person**: Generally held by those born in a British territory before 1983 who would otherwise have been born stateless by being born to a BPP.

## Acquisition (Birth, Descent, Registration, Naturalisation)

The 'standard' **British Citizen** status is further subdivided into two types: **by descent***, and **otherwise than by descent**. These terms are used primarily to determine whether a British citizen can impart citizenship on their progeny while abroad — to control acquisition abroad and maintain the perceived value attached to citizenship in the first place. 

The British Nationality Act 1981, effected the 1st of January 1983, makes the following provisions:<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a>

- **Section 1** *\[Acquisition by birth or adoption\]*

  - A person born in the United Kingdom or a qualifying territory shall be a British citizen if born to a British citizen, or to a parent settled in the UK or that territory.

- **Section 2** *\[Acquisition by descent\]*

  - A person born outside the United Kingdom and qualifying territories shall be a British citizen if born to a parent who is a British citizen otherwise than by descent.

- **Section 3** *\[Acquisition by registration: minors\]*

  - A person born outside the United Kingdom and qualifying territories shall be entitled – upon application – to be registered as a British citizen provided all of the following are fulfilled:
  
    - That person was born to a parent who is a British citizen by descent;
    
    - The above parent was born to a parent who is a British citizen otherwise than by descent **or**, they would have become a British citizen otherwise than by descent but for their death;
    
    - That person and his parent(s) were in the UK or a qualifying territory 3 years before the date of application and were not absent from the UK and qualifying territories for more than 270 days;
    
    - That person's parent(s) signified their consent to the registration.

- **Section 6, Subsection 2** *\[Acquisition by naturalisation\]*

  - A person of full age and capacity who – at the time of application – is married to/the civil partner of a British citizen, may be granted a certificate of naturalisation and hence become a British citizen provided they prove they:

    - Are of good character;
    
    - Have a sufficient working knowledge of English, Welsh, or Scottish Gaelic;
    
    - Have been in the UK for at least 3 years with no more than 270 days absent and doing so within the remit of immigration laws;
    
    - Have been in the UK for at least 12 months with no more than 90 days absent and isn't subject to restricted leave to remain.
