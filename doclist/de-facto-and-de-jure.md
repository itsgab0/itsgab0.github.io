# De Facto and De Jure

<br>

Within modern societies that preserve Latin terms for legal terminology, two stand out for their usage in describing a general legal situation in accordance with legal precedent:

- <span class="latin" style="font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:bold">'De facto'</span> — <span class="latin">(dē factō)</span> — *'according to fact'*
  - Existing as a fact althought it may not be legally accepted as existing.[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)
  - Actually existing, especially when without lawful authority.[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2)
- <span class="latin" style="font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:bold">'De jure'</span> — <span class="latin">(dē iūre)</span> — *'according to law'*
  - According to the law.[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)
  - By right; according to law.[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2)

However, these terms do not seem to cover the entire remit, occasionally requiring bulky constructions like "The leader holds de facto but not de jure power". Hence, herein I suggest a four-term complementary system of Latin terms permitting coverage of the states of precedence *(de jure)* and agreement in actuality *(de facto)* that might be required. Also shown below is the original Latin words that were used, and a pronunciation guide for each of the terms with the same **Anglified** treatment of the two established terms.

  <tr><th></th><th colspan=2>PRECEDENTED</th><th colspan=2>UNPRECEDENTED</th></tr>
  <tr><th rowspan=2>AGREEMENT</th><td rowspan=2>cum lege</td><td class="majuscule">(CVM·LE᷄GE)</td><td rowspan=2>sine lege</td><td class="majuscule">(SINE·LE᷄GE)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>(kə́m léjey)</td><td>(sáyn léjey)</td></tr>
  <tr><th rowspan=2>DISAGREEMENT</th><td rowspan=2>contra legem</td><td class="majuscule">(CONTRA᷄·LE᷄GEM)</td><td rowspan=2>intra legem</td><td class="majuscule">(INTRA᷄·LE᷄GEM)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>(kónchrə léjem)</td><td>(ínchrə léjem)</td></tr>
</table>

The bulk of the work in these terms is being done by the four varying prepositions, with the only notable difference in the second word of each term varying by inflection; in Latin both <span class="latin">cum</span> and <span class="latin">sine</span> precede an *ablative* noun, while <span class="latin">contra</span> and <span class="latin">intra</span> take an *accusative* noun.[<sup>3</sup>](#fn3)

The Classical Latin pronunciations, and the derivation of the English pronunciation of the above terms was as follows:

| LAT | LAT |  | ENG | ENG | DERIVATION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cvm | /kum/ | ⟶ | cum | /kʌm/ | (already brought to English) |
| sine | /ˈsi.nɛ/ | ⟶ | sine | /saɪn/ | (already brought to English) |
| contrā | /ˈkɔn.traː/ | ⟶ | contra | /ˈkɒn.trə/ | (as in contrary, contravene, etc.) |
| intrā | /ˈin.traː/ | ⟶ | intra | /ˈɪn.trə/ | (as in introduce, introspect, etc.) |
| lēge | /ˈleː.ge(m)/ | ⟶ | lege(m) | /ˈlɛ.dʒe(ɪ/m)/ | (as in leglislate, legible, etc.) |

Let us then contextualise these terms. Imagine a mythical state that houses a mighty goat in the capital city. Take the proposition: <span style="font-size:1.25rem;">**"You must not greet the goat"**</span>, and let us consider the following circumstances:

</br>

1) People do not greet the goat *(agreement)*, and the proposition is law *(precedented)*:
  - **"The city maintains a *cum lege* non-greeting goat policy"**; i.e., people follow the proposition *cum lege* (with \[a\] law).
2) People do not greet the goat *(agreement)*, but the law doesn't care *(unprecedented)*:
  - **"The goat is *sine lege* not greeted"**; i.e., people follow the proposition *sine lege* (without \[a\] law).
3) People greet the goat *(disagreement)*, but the proposition is law *(precedented)*:
  - **"There is a troublesome rise in *contra legem* goat-greeting"**; i.e., people flout the proposition *contra legem* (against \[the\] law).
4) People greet the goat *(disagreement)*, but the law doesn't care *(unprecedented)*:
  - **"Everybody *intra legem* greets the goat"**; i.e., people flout the proposition *intra legem* (within \[the\] law).
