      <p>An important part of languages and linguistics is the concept of morphemes. To simplify a rather complicated idea, a morpheme is a single unit of language that conveys some form of meaning. Think of the verb 'eat', which conveys the idea of consuming. Then, to take the verb form '<b>eaten</b>', we find two morphemes:</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li><b>eat-</b> ⟶ consuming</li>
        <li><b>-en</b> ⟶ [past tense] </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Not all languages work morphologically similar to English, which is itself considered a mostly <b>analytical language</b>. This means that English relies less on <b>inflection</b> - i.e. altering a root form of a word with affixes or other changes - and more on particles and helper words to get meaning across.</p>
      
      <p>For example, Latin has a case called the 'genitive', which inflects a noun for attribution. Take the noun 'Rōma' meaning 'Rome'. If one wants to say <em>the road to Rome</em>, merely inflect into the genitive case: <em>'via Rōmae</em>. Latin is considered a mainly synthetic language, as can be seen in the above case where English needed to add the particle 'to'. It should be noted that very few if any languages are completely analytical or synthetic.</p>
      
      <p>So next comes the idea of a morpheme map. When comparing two languages, one thing to take into account is the morphemic structure of both. In the example above, the noun <em>Rōmae</em> maps onto the English phrase <em>to Rome</em>. A few years ago, it was suggested as a little linguistic exercise (not part of any rigorous study) to translate the same phrase into several languages to see how the morphemes mapped onto each other.</p>
      
      <p>It was all based on the following phrase, with minor changes here and there: </p>
      
      <p><em>I would like to try on a suit I saw in a shop across the street from our hotel.</em></p>
      
      <p>The author has attempted to collate as many of these as possible, however a problem was that they were all formerly images with both colour-coding and lines drawn from morphemes. The author has thus made their best attempt to transcribe and encode them as text. Any and all errors should be attributed to the author instead of the original creators.</p>
      
      <p>Additionally, an attempt has been made to add transliterations for non-Latin scripts. The author is more familiar with some than others. Also, where possible, the author has attempted to more-thoroughly map individual morphemes rather than whole words as in some of the original pieces. As such, there are many possibilities for error in the transcription, the transliterations, and the colour-coding. Please don't treat this with anything other than a very mild enthusiasm.</p>
      
      <p>One problem should be noted prior, and that is of word-order. One finds that while word-order is quite important in analytical languages - such as in the phrase <em>'Tim eats the chicken.'</em> being quite a bit more preferable than <em>'The chicken eats Tim'</em> - a completely valid sentence with the exact same words - in synthetic languages where words are inflected, this problem arises much less often as the meaning is embedded within each word unit, and hence word-order is less restrictive - as such it has been presumed the most 'natural-sounding' word order has been taken in each case.</p>
